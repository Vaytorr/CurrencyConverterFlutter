# Currency Converter Flutter

***This is a currency converter app made using Flutter/Dart and HG finance API***

**This is one of my firt projects using Flutter**

**This app was made following an udemy tutorial**

**I made this app to learn how to use flutter, so don't expect much**

The app can convert from and to (USD, EUR, BRL and Bitcoin)

Why doesn't it support more currencies? As I said I made this app to learn Flutter

This app is quite old, so, somethings may not work with newer versions of the packages used
